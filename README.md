# ArchitectureDeck
An AI architecture and diagram builder for product teams  ArchDock turns either (1) a GitHub repository or (2) a plain English idea into a clear system design. It outputs a practical architecture plan, an opinionated tech stack, tradeoffs, and a high quality diagram that matches the target scale and constraints.
